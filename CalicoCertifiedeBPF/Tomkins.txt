Hi @Chris Tomkins - it's late but I'm really keen to kick on w/ the eBPF course so here are some "thoughts" as I progress...  

Week #1 "Compiling and Running the Renamed Programs" maybe "stress" importance of sudo first e.g. sudo ./bootstrap otherwise may get surprise on error Failed to increase RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limit!   ... Week #1 "Writing a Kernel Probel for Tracing" maybe specify kernel version before hand?  I updated to 5.15.2 before course and was prompted to update linux-tools and linux-cloud tools


Cannot run bpftool on personal Linux PC as I have Ubuntu 20.04
will have to do the course in one sitting??


Inconsistency:
Week 1 Enter LibBPF	says BTF Type Format (BTF)
Week 1 BTF		says BPF Type Format, or BTF


Week 2	Lab Setup
Initialising and Authenticating to GCP

could not create new cloud project 	ccol2ebpf

so instead I created steveproebpf
e.g.
gcloud projects create steveproebpf
gcloud config set project steveproebpf
gcloud config list

BUT on my personal account
I had to setup billing


Week 2	Deploy Calico with eBPF on Upstream Kubernetes
#8	Testing Performance with Calicoâ€™s eBPF Data Plane

Does this text need to be updated?
TBC - IF YOU'RE TESTING THE COURSE, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WITH CHRIS TOMKINS ABOUT THIS...


Weird - all pods were running but I get error:

Week 2	Intro to Online Boutique
#1	Deploying Online Boutique

kubectl get pods -o wide

I don't think this the correct output - it looks like the output from 
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
