Hi Chris - the course looks great and very thorough - I did notice a couple of very minor things e.g. 

Week #1 : is there an inconsistency with "BTF Type Format (BTF)" in Understanding the Tools on tab #3 but then referenced as "BPF Type Format, or BTF" on tab #5...?

Week #2 : very minor : I think the text says kubectl get pods but the command was meant to be kubectl get pods -o wide...?


Finally, here are maybe 3x suggestions / findings I also noticed:
Thanks,
Steven.


#1.
Week 1	Writing an eBPF Program
Tab# 7 	Compiling and Running the Renamed Programs

Maybe mention if you do not run programs as root i.e. using sudo then you may get the error "Failed to increase RLIMIT_MEMLOCK limit!"...?


#2.
Week 2	Deploy Calico with eBPF on Upstream Kubernetes
Tab# 8	Testing Performance with Calicoâ€™s eBPF Data Plane

Does this page need to be updated?
TBC - IF YOU'RE TESTING THE COURSE, PLEASE GET IN TOUCH WITH CHRIS TOMKINS ABOUT THIS...


#3.
Week 3	Deploying Calico with eBPF on AKS
Tab# 1	Deploying an Azure AKS Cluster with Azure CNI and Calico for policy with eBPF
