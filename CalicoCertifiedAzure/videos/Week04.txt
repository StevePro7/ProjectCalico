Self-managed clusters [video]

Deploy self-managed cluster in Azure

kOps in Calico AWS is in the alpha stages of Azure adoption
and will error out during the cluster creation

Rancher requires explanation on how to create an Azure VM

kubespray requires knowledge in Ansible


SUMMARY
Cluster API
a Kubernetes sub project w/ effort to use Kubernetes style APIs to
automate cluster lifecycle management

Declarative = idempotent

supports all major cloud providers thru Kubernetes cloud provider APIs


C API
lives inside Kubernetes
uses CRDs custom reource definitions to extend ordinary Kubernetes cluster into capable maintainer and deployment solution
  
after deployment
cluster = management cluster


C APZ
allow management cluster to communicate w/ Azure

after installing the provider, delcare cloud account identity
then apply YAML file to the management cluster

C API uses C APZ to issue API commands and Azure will translate those
into cloud resources


Finally, due to current limitations, we cannot use CloudShell to run
our local management cluster
