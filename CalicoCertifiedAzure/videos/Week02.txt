AKS Deployment Overview [Video]

Multiple ways to deploy AKS cluster
- Azure portal GUI
- ARM templates
- Azure CLI


Azure portal
official GUI to create, manage, deploy your AKS cloud resources
always up-to-date

Create resource
Kubernetes service
create

Region
close to customers
each region has 3x Availability zones	three

You need to select more than one >1 availability zone here to have
availability among your control plane nodes

If Kubernetes workloads require specific version of Kubernetes then
adjust it here


Default node code value = 3 three
free a/c may have issue when upgrade cluster

always choose 1 node [one] as necessary


In Azure, nodes are members of a node pool
click current node pool

IMPORTANT
first node in node pool must be a Linux machine to run the Kubernetes
system workloads
i.e.
cannot be Windows for first node

Optional settings
max pods per node dropdown
how many pods are allowed to run on a single node
minimum value is 10 ten	hardcoded by Azure

max pods per node
250 Azure CNI
110 kubenet

value enforced by AKS services
if you need to increase max pods per node after deployment then 
you must create another node pool w/ the new setting and migrate
all of your workloads to the new node pool


If you add a Windows node to your cluster as a secondary node
[remember that first node in node pool must be Linux node]
then you need to make sure the plugin under networking tab is set to
Azure CNI otherwise you will get error

Windows node pools are not supported on kubenet clusters



Networking CNI options
Kubenet
Azure CNI

Network policy options
Node
Calico
Azure

IMPORTANT
Azure network policy is not compatible with kubenet networking


Matrix
Network configuration		Network policy
kubenet				None, Calico
Azure CNI			None, Calico, Azure


Portal
kubenet networking plug-in	creates new VNet for cluster
Azure CNI networking plug-in	allows clusters to use new/exist VNet 


Calico network policy deployed to AKS will install version of Calico
from Microsfot image repository

None option = Kubernetes cluster without a policy enforcer but you can
install the latest version of Calico and manually configure it


Other tabs / options require configuring all Azure CNI latest vendor
based features


ARM
Azure Resoure Manager is a declarative way to deploy Azure resources
using code

ARM template is a regular JSON file that contains detail what resources
must be deployed

Export ARM template => use w/ Azure CLI or Azure portal to create resources

Azure CLI is the official command-line utility to interact w/ the 
Azure cloud platform
