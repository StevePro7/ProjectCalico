systemctl status kubelet


cat /etc/cni/etd.d
cat /etc/cni/etd.d/10_calico



kubectl describe -n kube-system kubeadm-config


calico-node
creates veth pairs for pods to be attached to the nodes
handles the network policies as well


kubectl get apiservice

kubectl api-resources


calico-kube-controllers
network policy based on labels and selectors
as
cannot base network security on pods IP addresses
[ephemeral]



calico-typha
sits in between
calico node and calico api server
multiplex messages
don't want every calico node connecting to the calico api server


ssh worker1

ip route

IP addresses connected to ineterface that calico created



kubectl api-resources | grep network



YAO Bank
ssh into customer pod	Web UI

for i in {1..5000}; do curl --connect-timeout 1 http://database:2379/v2/keys?recursive=true ; sleep 3; done



control plane
handles the traffic routing


data plane
represents the traffic in that network


eBPF
ssh into calico-node

get database pod


calico-node -bpf conntrack dump | grep <database_ip>



enable ebpf
create configMap	tell calico-node now to comm w/ k8s api server
remove kube-proxy
enable eBPF dataplane
i.e.
update Installation YAML config 
Linux Dataplane: BPF
