Pg.29
Egress traffic handled at the networking level determined by the Kubernetes
network implementation / CNI plugin being used by the cluster


Limitation to Kubernetes Network Policy restricting access to external resources
as specified by IP addresses or IP address ranges when the external resource
changes then the IP addresses must be changed

instead
can use Calico Network Sets or Calico Enterprise domain names in policy rules


Pg.30
NAT outgoing
Kubernetes egress NAT is used to allow pods to connect to services outside cluster
if pods have IP address that are not routable outside cluster [e.g. overlay network]

Calico can also use IP Pools to configure more granular level for particular IP
address ranges and scope "non-routable" to be more tight than inside vs. outside cluster


Egress gateway
perform direct security role in terms of what connections it allows
e.g
sees connections from well known IP address [egress gateway] rather than
from dynamic pod IP addresses they don't understand


Calico allows you to control pod IP address ranges based on
namespace, node, or individual pod level
