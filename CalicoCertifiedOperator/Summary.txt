Intro


Week01
Lab setup

create 4x
control
node1
node2
host1


host1
k get nodes
Not ready because	no networking	no CNI plugin installed


install CNI plugin
tigera  operator


install Calico
specify IP Pool


confirm different calico pods
calico node
calico typha
calico kube contoller


Setup sample Application



Week02
Network Policy

Network Policies are abstracted from the network by using label selectors
as their primary mechanism for identifying workloads rather than IP addresses [ranges]


Kubernetes objects
NetworkPolicy

Calico Network Policy
NetworkPolicy
GlobalNetworkPolicy


Network Policy
think of NP as providing a Firewall in front of every pod built into pod network

also Calico NP providing a Firewall in front of very nodes network interfaces
"Host Endpoints"


Istio Integration
enforcing network policy at 
- service mesh layer
- pod network layer

provides
defense in depth for zero trust network security model


Calico Enterprise


Best Practices
- restrict ingress and egress traffic
- standardize label schema and network policy	e.g. app label
- implement default deny policy to prevent traffic not explicitly allowed by other policy
- OR implement default app policy to pods + exclude kube-system + calico-system
- implement Hierarchical Network Policy if have Calico Enterprise


Lab
lockdown database microservice direct access
implement Calico GlobalNetworkPolicy for default-deny	for entire cluster

Lab
Lazy Policy
Lockdown Cluster Egress
Grant Selective Cluster Egress

Managing Trust Across Teams


Manage Hosts and NodePorts		Host endpoints protection outside cluster

Lab
lockdown host endpoint



Week03

Calico networking on Linux nodes

Lab
How Pods See the Network
How Hosts See Connections to Pods
cali...
veth pair connect customer pod to the host network namespace

How Hosts Route Pod Traffic


Wireguard
line another overlay network option but with encryption


Lab
Enabling Encryption


IP Pools + BGP Peering
Lab
Cluster IP Address Ranges
Create IP Pools with Different Scopes
Configure BGP Peering
Configure a Namespace to use External Routable IP Addresses



Week04

Kubernetes services

understanding kube-proxy

Lab
Examine Kubernetes Services

Kube-Proxy Cluster IP Implementation
KUBE-SERVICES
KUBE-SVC
KUBE-SEP


Kube-Proxy NodePort Implementation
KUBE-NODEPORTS


Calico native service handling
eBPF

NodePort without source IP preservation

Source IP preservation
Direct Server Return (DSR)


Advertising Services
Lab

Advertise External IPs
Assign the service external IP
