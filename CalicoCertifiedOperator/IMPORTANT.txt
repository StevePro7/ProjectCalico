Install Calico via Tigera Operator
 
 multipass shell host1
 kubectl get tigerastatus/calico
 
 kubectl get pods -n calico-system
 
 
 calico-node: Calico-node runs on every Kubernetes cluster node as a DaemonSet. It is responsible for enforcing network policy, setting up routes on the nodes, plus managing any virtual interfaces for IPIP, VXLAN, or WireGuard.
 
calico-typha: Typha is as a stateful proxy for the Kubernetes API server. It's used by every calico-node pod to query and watch Kubernetes resources without putting excessive load on the Kubernetes API server.  The Tigera Operator automatically scales the number of Typha instances as the cluster size grows.

calico-kube-controllers: Runs a variety of Calico specific controllers that automate synchronization of resources. For example, when a Kubernetes node is deleted, it tidies up any IP addresses or other Calico resources associated with the node.

Host endpoints
what Calico calls a network policy that provides a firewall in front of each node network interfaces

calicoctl
The calicoctl utility is used to create and manage Calico resource types, as well as allowing you to run a range of other Calico specific commands. In this specific case, we are creating a GlobalNetworkPolicy (GNP).

Calico CRD
HostEndpoint
interface on the node
e.g.
host endpoint applies to the node's interface to the underlying network: eth0

interface: "*"
corresponds to all network interfaces on the host
e.g.
those network interfaces connecting the host to the pods and the loopback interface

Calico HostEndpoints Lab
calicoctl get heps

calicoctl patch kubecontrollersconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"controllers": {"node": {"hostEndpoint": {"autoCreate": "Enabled"}}}}}'

IMPORTANT
So we always recommend ensuring you have the correct failsafe ports configured before you start applying network policies to host endpoints!

eth0 is a link to the host network namespace (indicated by link-netnsid 0). This is the pod's side of the virtual ethernet pair (veth pair) that connects the pod to the node’s host network namespace.
The @if9 at the end of the interface name (on eth0) is the interface number for the other end of the veth pair, which is located within the host's network namespace itself.  In this example, interface number 9. Remember this number for later. You might want to write it down, because we will need to know this number when we take a look at the other end of the veth pair shortly.

ssh node1

ip link show up


veth pair connects pod network namespace to the host [node] network namespace


How Hosts Route Pod Traffic
ssh node1
ip route

We can also see several routes labeled proto bird. These are routes to pods on other nodes that Calico has learned over BGP.

The blackhole route tells Linux that if it can't find a more specific route for an individual IP in that block then it should discard the packet (rather than sending it out the default route to the network). Y


Enabling Encryption
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":true}}'
calicoctl get node node1 -o yaml

ssh node1
ip addr | grep wireguard


Disabling Encryption
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --type='merge' -p '{"spec":{"wireguardEnabled":false}}'
calicoctl get node node1 -o yaml


Introduction to IP Pools
IP POols
Calico resources which define ranges of IP addresses that the Calico IPAM + IPAM CNI plugin can use


KKubernetes Configuration

The cluster pod CIDR is the range of IP addresses Kubernetes is expecting to be assigned to pods in the cluster.
The services CIDR is the range of IP addresses that are used for the Cluster IPs of Kubernetes Sevices (the virtual IP that corresponds to each Kubernetes Service).

kubectl cluster-info dump | grep -m 2 -E "service-cidr|cluster-cidr"


Calico configuration
calicoctl get ippools

Note that these IP address ranges are CIDRs, not subnets. This distinction is a little subtle, but in a strict networking sense subnet implies L2 connectivity within the subnet, but the Kubernetes networking model is oriented around L3 connectivity.

subnet	L2 connectivity
K8s	L3 connectivity	networking model


Create IP Pools with Different Scopes
calicoctl get ippools 


 BGP Peering
ssh node1


Add a BGP Peer
ssh node1
sudo calicoctl node status


Configure a Namespace to use External Routable IP Addresses



Check Calico IPAM allocations statistics
calicoctl ipam show

It can be a good idea to periodically check IP allocations statistics to check you have sized your IP pools appropriately, for example if you aren’t confident about the number of pods and whether your original sizing of the pools.


QUIZ
Overlay networks
encapsulate pod to pod packets inside node to node packets
can be implemented using IPIP
can be implemented using VXLAN
can be implemented using WireGuard with the added benefit of encryption

WireGuard
can be thought of as an overlay network with the added benefit of encryption
uses state of the art encryption
can be used by Calico to secure all pod to pod traffic over the underlying network

Calico IP Pools
define ranges of IP addresses that can be used for Calico IPAM
define IP rnage specific network behaviors such as overlay modes or NAT outgoing
can be constrained to only be used by specific nodes, namespaces, or pods
define the block sizes to be used in BGP route aggregation

BGP is
a standards based routing protocol supported by most routers
used to build the internet
can be used between Calico nodes to share routes
can be used to share routes between Calico and the underlying network
can be used to share services IPs with the underlying network
often used in on-prem or private cloud networks


Week04
Kube-proxy
uses Linux iptables rules by default for load balancing

other options
IPVS
eBPF


Kube-Proxy Cluster IP Implementation
kubectl get endpoints -n yaobank summary

SSH into node1 so we can explore the iptables rules that kube-proxy has set up on that node
ssh node1


To make it easier to manage large numbers of iptables rules, groups of iptables rules can be grouped together into iptables chains.

sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SERVICES


Each iptables chain consists of a list of rules that are executed in order until a rule matches. 

KUBE-SERVICES -> KUBE-SVC-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SERVICES | grep -E summary


checkout how load balancing works
e.g.
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SVC-OIQIZJVJK6E34BR4


SVC	service
SEP	service endpoint

Service endpoint
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SEP-MR2OHPODPKVEKHD4
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SEP-KGQRHMYN3EBQMPXF

rule performs DNAT that changes the destination IP from the service cluster IP
to the IP address of the service endpoint backing pod

after this standard Linux routing can handle forwarding the packet as before


Recap
kube-proxy iptables rules used to load balance traffic to summary pods exposed as service type
ClusterIP

recap packet being sent to clusterIP
KUBE-SERVICES chain matches on the clusterIP and jumps to corresponding KUBE-SVC-XXXX chain
KUBE-SVC-XXXX chain load balances the packet to random service endpoint KUBE-SEP-XXXX chain
KUBE-SEP-XXXX chain DNAT the packet so it will get routed to the service endpoint [backing pod]


Kube-Proxy NodePort Implementation
kubectl get endpoints -n yaobank customer

sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SERVICES | grep KUBE-NODEPORTS


ssh node1
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SERVICES | grep KUBE-NODEPORTS

sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-NODEPORTS


KUBE-SVC-XXXX => KUBE-SEP-XXXX
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SVC-PX5FENG4GZJTCELT

single backing pod for customer SVC = no load balancing
sudo iptables -v --numeric --table nat --list KUBE-SEP-UBXKSM3V2OSEF4IL


secon rule performs the DNAT that changes the destination IP from the service clusterIP 
to the IP address of the service endpoint backing pod


Recap
kube-proxy iptables rules used to load balance traffic to customer pods
exposed as a service of type NodePort

packet being sent to NodePort
KUBE-SERVICES chain jumps to the KUBE-NODEPORTS chain

KUBE-NODEPORTS chain matches on the NodePort and jumps to the corresponding KUBE-SVC-XXXX chain
KUBE-SVC-XXXX chain load balances the packet to a random service endpoint KUBE-SEP-XXXX chain
KUBE-SEP-XXXX chain DNAT the packet so it will get routed tot he service endpoint backing pod


Introduction to Calico Native Service Handling

About Calico eBPF dataplane
is an alternative to the default standard Linux dataplane
[which is iptables based]


Lab
2x terminals
kubectl logs -n yaobank -l app=customer --follow

curl 198.19.0.1:30180

when traffic arrives from outside the cluster kube-proxy applies SNAT to the traffic
on the ingress node from pod POV this makes the traffic appear to come from the ingress node

SNAT is required to make sure the return traffic flows back trhu the same node so that
NodePort DNAT can be undone


if cluster configured to use an overlay [VXLAN, IPIP, WireGuard] then the SNAT would make the
traffic appear to come from the IP address associated with the corresponding virtual interface
on the ingress node


Enable Calico eBPF
apply configMap and restart the Tigera operator

kubectl delete pod -n tigera-operator -l k8s-app=tigera-operator

watch Calico pods
watch kubectl get pods -n calico-system

Disable kube-proxy
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"bpfKubeProxyIptablesCleanupEnabled": false}}'

Switch on eBPF mode
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"bpfEnabled": true}}'


kubectl delete pod -n yaobank -l app=customer
kubectl delete pod -n yaobank -l app=summary


Source IP preservation
kubectl logs -n yaobank -l app=customer --follow

curl 198.19.0.1:30180
doesn't work


Snoop traffic without DSR
ssh control
sudo tcpdump -nvi any 'tcp port 30180'


other terminal
curl 198.19.0.1:30180


Switch on DSR
calicoctl patch felixconfiguration default --patch='{"spec": {"bpfExternalServiceMode": "DSR"}}'

curl 198.19.0.1:30180
should now only see traffic in one direction
from host1 to the node port on the control node
198.19.15.254 => 198.19.0.1


Introduction to Advertising Services

Advertise Cluster IP Range
ip route

apply BGP configuration
calicoctl get bgpconfig default -o yaml


ip route
ECMP
Equal Cost Multi Path

kubectl get svc -n yaobank customer

curl clusterIP
curl 198.19.40.178

Advertising Cluster IPs in this way provides an alternative to accessing services via Node Ports


Advertise External IPs

Update BGP configuration
calicoctl patch BGPConfig default --patch \
   '{"spec": {"serviceExternalIPs": [{"cidr": "198.19.48.0/20"}]}}'

ip route


Assign the service external IP
kubectl patch svc -n yaobank customer -p  '{"spec": {"externalIPs": ["198.19.48.10"]}}'

kubectl get svc -n yaobank
NOW customer NodePort has an External IP

curl 198.19.48.10
the service has been made available outside the cluster via BGP routing and 
network load balancing


Review
5x different ways to conntect pods from outside the cluster
1. via standard NodePort on a specific node
2. direct to the pod IP address by using externally routable IP Pools
3. advertizing the service cluster IP range
4. advertizing individual cluster IPs
5. advertizing service external-IPs
