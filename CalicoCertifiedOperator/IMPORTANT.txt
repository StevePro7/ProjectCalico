Install Calico via Tigera Operator
 
 multipass shell host1
 kubectl get tigerastatus/calico
 
 kubectl get pods -n calico-system
 
 
 calico-node: Calico-node runs on every Kubernetes cluster node as a DaemonSet. It is responsible for enforcing network policy, setting up routes on the nodes, plus managing any virtual interfaces for IPIP, VXLAN, or WireGuard.
 
calico-typha: Typha is as a stateful proxy for the Kubernetes API server. It's used by every calico-node pod to query and watch Kubernetes resources without putting excessive load on the Kubernetes API server.  The Tigera Operator automatically scales the number of Typha instances as the cluster size grows.

calico-kube-controllers: Runs a variety of Calico specific controllers that automate synchronization of resources. For example, when a Kubernetes node is deleted, it tidies up any IP addresses or other Calico resources associated with the node.
