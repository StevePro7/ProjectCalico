Network Policy
primary tool for security Kubernetes network


network topologies of routers, switches and firewalls were used to secure networks


Now clusters in Kubernetes secured using Network Policy instead Network topology

Network Policy use label selectors as the primary mechanism for identifying workloads
rather than IP addresses or IP address ranges


Kubernetes has based Network policy which does nothing but store it
it is the network plugins that enforce the policy


Traditional firewalls struggle w/ dynamic nature of K8s
because they are used to static IP address [ranges]

still use firewalls at perimeter to control North / South traffic
