01.
What happens if I get "Problems" and they won't be "fixed" with
go mod tidy

How to resolve problems?
How to know who to speak to etc?


02.
What happens if I get changes in checked in source files
e.g.
go.sum

Do I check these in?
Surely not...



03.
There is SOOOOO much code so how do they decide what packages to use?
e.g.
cache.go
/home/stevepro/GitHubX/ProjectCalico/typha/pkg/snapcache

import
github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures/trie/ctrie
