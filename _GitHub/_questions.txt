01.
What happens if I get "Problems" and they won't be "fixed" with
go mod tidy

How to resolve problems?
How to know who to speak to etc?


02.
What happens if I get changes in checked in source files
e.g.
go.sum

Do I check these in?
Surely not...



03.
There is SOOOOO much code so how do they decide what packages to use?
e.g.
cache.go
/home/stevepro/GitHubX/ProjectCalico/typha/pkg/snapcache

import
github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures/trie/ctrie

source code found here
https://github.com/Workiva/go-datastructures/blob/master/trie/ctrie/ctrie.go


04.
What if you open a repo that has no main.go or no package main
e.g.
libacalico-go

how do you build / debug / run the source code?
may be this is a "pure" library so you just write code and go test code?

actually I think I worked this out:
just debug step thru the code from corresponding test
e.g.
block_test.go
/home/stevepro/GitHubX/ProjectCalico/libcalico-go/lib/backend/model/


05.
How to debug step thru source code
e.g.
cni-plugin

esp.
when the debug filename is not in the list from switch statement
calico.go
